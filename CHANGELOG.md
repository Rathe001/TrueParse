# TrueParse Changelog

## 1.2.0 (unreleased)

- Letter grades are gone: scores are a color-coded 0-100 in Warcraft Logs
  parse colors, everywhere (scorecard, breakdown panel, chat reports,
  career, coach).
- Score modes: the default TrueParse contribution score, or a WCL-style
  parse mode (/tp mode) that grades pure damage/healing against top logs
  for your spec on this fight - no utility, no penalties.
- CI: the test suite now runs on every push; the benchmark refresh skips
  green when its API key isn't configured.

## 1.1.0

- Hover a scorecard row to open the breakdown panel directly (click pins it);
  big grade-colored score in the panel header; rewritten plain-language
  hover tooltips.
- Score colors now match Warcraft Logs parse brackets, including pink at 99+
  and gold at a perfect 100.
- Threat discipline (Classic): body pulls, aggro rips, and tank aggro losses
  are tracked and penalized (lightly, with fairness gates). Retail ships a
  threat readability probe.
- Wipe-aware scoring: boss wipes are labeled, death penalties soften on
  them, top-damage trophies don't grant, and they don't drag career GPA.
- New awards: Not on My Watch, Topped Off, Healed Through Stupid (healers),
  Giant Slayer (boss top damage), Lawnmower (trash top damage) — plus an
  on-screen award toast with fanfare (toggleable).
- Augmentation: SUPPORT is now scored primarily on self-reported Ebon Might
  uptime when the Aug runs TrueParse (35% weight, 100 points at 60% uptime).
- /tp trends: score and per-metric direction over your recent fights, plus
  per-zone averages. Numeric score now sits beside the letter grade,
  grade-colored. Version-update nag when a groupmate runs a newer TrueParse.

## 1.0.0

First public release.

- Group Contribution Score (0-100, S+ through F letter grades): damage,
  effective healing + absorbs, damage soaked (tanks), interrupts, dispels —
  normalized per spec, per fight, and per item level, with penalties for
  avoidable damage, deaths (timing-aware), and missing raid buffs.
- Scoring anchored to Warcraft Logs statistics: per-encounter and per-dungeon
  spec medians (retail Midnight + MoP Classic), blended with in-group
  comparison; solo-role scores cap below perfection.
- Post-fight scorecard with clickable player rows, plain-language breakdown
  bullets (numbers on hover), a clickable group summary row, and awards:
  Kick King, Cleanser, Untouchable, Lifesaver, Survivalist, Iron Wall.
- Coach line after bosses: your grade and the one change that would have
  raised it most. Career stats (/tp career), run report cards (/tp run),
  opt-in group chat summaries (/tp share, /tp announce).
- TrueParse users share their own combat facts (defensive cooldowns used,
  consumables at the pull, defensives available at death) over a hidden
  addon channel — data Blizzard hides from everyone except the player
  themselves. Informational only, never scored.
- Retail (Midnight) and Mists of Pandaria Classic support.
